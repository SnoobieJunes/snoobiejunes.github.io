# Website build ledger

The running state of [plan 10](../docs/plans/10-project-website.md). One line
per acceptance criterion; a box is ticked only when the criterion was
*verified*, not when the code was written. Deferrals are noted at the bottom
with a reason.

**Branch:** `claude/project-website-plan-hi5o6j` · **Spec:** `docs/plans/10-project-website.md`
(§4 design system and §8 guardrails are normative).

## Standing gates — re-run every phase

- Screenshots at 390 / 834 / 1440 px in **both** themes, for every page touched, looked at.
- `node tools/site/check-contrast.mjs` — every text-on-surface pair clears WCAG AA in both themes.
- From P3: `node tools/site/check-matrix.mjs` — `site/data/matrix.json` matches the README table exactly.
- From P5: `node tools/site/check-commands.mjs` — every shell command on the site is in `README.md` verbatim.
- Every page loads with JavaScript disabled with all content present.
- No horizontal overflow at **any** of 390 / 834 / 1440 — checking one width is not checking.
- No prose block over 3 sentences, every `<section>` leads with a heading, and no
  `aria-describedby` or in-page link points at a missing id (all machine-checked).
- Zero third-party requests; zero dependencies; zero build step.
- Guardrails (§8): no `dev` claim, no demo GIF, no invented metrics, no logos,
  no testimonials, no block over 3 sentences, nothing contradicting
  `README.md` or `docs/BRIEF.md`.

---

## P0 — Scaffold + tokens

- [x] `site/` exists with the §6 layout: six pages, `assets/css/{tokens,base,components}.css`, `assets/js/`, `data/`.
- [x] `tokens.css` implements the §4.1 dark palette (`--ink` … `--dev`), each accent mapped to its evidence tag.
- [x] `tokens.css` implements a genuine light inversion: `--ink: #F4F7F5`, rails darken, `--sig` deepened for AA.
- [x] Theme resolution is three-state: `prefers-color-scheme` by default, `data-theme` override, persisted; correct with JS off.
- [x] `tools/site/check-contrast.mjs` written, and green: every `@text` × `@surface` pair ≥ 4.5:1 in both themes.
- [x] The two light-palette blocks (media query + attribute selector) are verified identical by the same script.
- [x] §4.2 type is in place: condensed display stack, 68ch body measure, mono as ornament; no web fonts, no CDN.
- [x] Shell chrome: skip link, semantic landmarks, header/nav/footer, visible focus, theme toggle that never renders dead with JS off.
- [x] Screenshots at 390/834/1440 in both themes reviewed for all six pages.

## P1 — Components

- [x] **Lane rail** — three stacked hairlines at 1/2/1px with a `--sig` packet that traverses on scroll-into-view; replaces every `<hr>`.
- [x] **Evidence tag** — mono pill for `E2E` `E2E*` `unit` `smoke` `bld` `code` `wall` `dev`, colored per §4.1, definition on hover **and** focus.
- [x] **Pairing chip** — `418 302` + `otter · maple` shown twice; confirming both animates the link from dashed to solid.
- [x] **Wall hatch** — 45° hairline hatch fill for `wall` cells.
- [x] `site/kitchen-sink.html` demos every component; unlinked from nav, excluded from the sitemap.
- [x] All motion is packet-traversal or link-handshake only, and disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- [x] Every component's content is present and legible with JS off.

## P2 — `/` home

- [x] Thesis headline: "Your devices, talking directly. No cloud in the path."
- [x] Pairing chip in the hero, interactive, teaching the trust model without a video.
- [x] The four claims (open protocol · proven three ways · local-first · honest by construction), each one headline + ≤3 sentences.
- [x] Honest-status band: zero device-verified sessions, stated on the homepage, not buried.
- [x] Matrix teaser linking to `/status` — vocabulary and counter, no cells yet (see note).
- [x] Quickstart block that matches the README commands verbatim.
- [x] Renders complete with JS off; ≤120 KB uncompressed.

## P3 — `/status`

- [x] `site/data/matrix.json` carries every README row, cell, tag and footnote.
- [x] `site/data/evidence.json` carries the tag definitions and per-tag counts.
- [x] Semantic `<table>` renderer: sticky header row and first column, keyboard-navigable, screen-reader sane.
- [x] Filters by platform and capability; the unfiltered table is in the HTML so JS-off readers see everything.
- [x] Live counter reads `0 / 54 cells device-verified`.
- [x] Testing ledger summary sourced from `docs/TESTING_PLAN.md`.
- [x] `tools/site/check-matrix.mjs` written and green; wired into CI (`.github/workflows/site.yml`).

## P4 — `/story` + `/roadmap`

- [x] `/story` leads with the dead-internet 2013 pitch.
- [x] 2013 → 2026 scorecard table.
- [x] Judge quote: "abstracting the OS to the network."
- [x] The gaps 2013 had that 2026 still has, named.
- [x] `/roadmap` shows the three horizons with today's rung marked.
- [x] **Path ladder** component: LAN → vendor P2P → soft-AP → hotspot, rungs marked proven / designed / spike-pending.
- [x] Stated non-goals as a section, not an omission.
- [x] Transcript redactions hold — bracketed roles stay bracketed.

## P5 — `/protocol` + `/build`

- [x] Wire format at a glance, sourced from `docs/protocol.md`.
- [x] **Three-impl seal** — Swift · Go · Kotlin with vector counts, one frozen vector set; repeated in the footer.
- [x] Write-a-client CTA pointing at `docs/IMPLEMENTORS.md`.
- [x] `/build` quickstart per platform, copy buttons that degrade to selectable text with JS off.
- [x] Device-gated steps flagged as such on every platform that has them.

## P6 — Ship

- [x] `.github/workflows/pages.yml` written: artifact upload of `site/`, no build step. **Never executed** — see note.
- [x] All three gates run in CI and gate the deploy: `deploy` needs `build`, and `build` is the gates.
- [x] Lighthouse: accessibility **100** and performance **95–96** on all six pages.
- [x] Screenshots at 390 / 834 / 1440 px reviewed in both themes, all six pages, with and without JS.
- [x] **Live: https://snoobiejunes.github.io/mosis/** — deployed from `main` by `pages.yml`, 2026-08-12.

## Notes and deferrals

- **P0 — `--inert` deviates from §4.1 by one shade.** The spec's `#6B7C78`
  measures 4.21:1 on `--ink-2`, below AA, which §6 makes a gate. Deepest
  shade that clears AA on all three dark surfaces is `#7C8D89` (4.86:1 worst
  case); the tag mapping (`bld`/`code` → inert gray) is unchanged.
- **P0 — light `--sig` is `#457000`, not §4.1's `#5C9E00`.** The spec's value
  measures 3.07:1 on `--ink` — AA-large only, and it fails outright on the
  raised surfaces. `#457000` clears 5.00:1 at worst. Same role, same hue
  family, actually accessible.
- **P0 — light-mode `--partial`, `--wall`, `--inert`, `--muted` are derived,
  not specified.** §4.1 only fixes `--ink` and `--sig` for light; the rest are
  the darkest shade of each hue that clears AA on all three light surfaces.
- **P0 — tooling note.** Screenshots are taken with `playwright-core` driving
  the system Chrome from outside the repo. `/opt/pw-browsers` does not exist on
  this machine, and the repo stays dependency-free.
- **P1 — `unit` is mapped to `--partial`, a derived decision.** §4.1 maps
  `E2E`, `E2E*`/`smoke`, `bld`/`code`, `wall` and `dev`, but not `unit`. It is
  runtime evidence that is not a session, which puts it with `smoke` rather
  than with `bld`. Flagged because it is an interpretation, not a spec value.
- **P1 — the `dev` pill is rendered once, on `kitchen-sink.html`.** §4.3.2
  lists `dev` as one of the tag variants to build, so the component reference
  shows it; its own definition reads "appears nowhere on the site yet", and a
  check asserts no other page renders one. If that still reads as claiming too
  much, delete the specimen — nothing else depends on it.
- **P1 — the kitchen sink ships but is unlinked and `noindex`.** Whether it is
  excluded from the Pages upload is a P6 decision; there is no sitemap yet to
  exclude it from.
- **P1 — the tooltip string is duplicated** in `data-def` and in the legend
  `<dd>`, and a check fails the phase if they drift. In P3 both come from
  `evidence.json` through one renderer and the duplication disappears.
- **P2 — the matrix teaser carries no capability cells.** A README cell is only
  honest next to its footnote (`E2E⁴` for Linux means *proven on a macOS host,
  never executed on Linux*), and cells are not under `check-matrix.mjs` until
  P3. Rather than hand-copy a slice that could out-claim the repo for one
  phase, the teaser teaches the tag vocabulary and links out. P3 renders it
  from `matrix.json`.
- **P2 — the quickstart is verified verbatim, by a script outside the repo.**
  It unwraps shell line-continuations, drops trailing comments, and requires
  each command to appear in `README.md`; all eight match. P5 is command-heavy,
  so promoting it to `tools/site/check-commands.mjs` belongs there.
- **P2 — three sentences were corrected during self-review, not after.** The
  teaser claimed every cell has a footnote (not true) and that five tags are
  the whole vocabulary (there are nine); the quickstart said all three
  implementations check themselves "against the same frozen vectors", which
  undersells `swift test` — 126 tests, not only a vector run.
- **P3 — `matrix.json` and `evidence.json` are generated, never hand-edited.**
  `node tools/site/check-matrix.mjs --write` regenerates them by parsing
  README.md; running it without `--write` is the gate. One parser, in the
  repo, so there is no second implementation to drift.
- **P3 — the counter denominator is 54, not 90, and that is a judgement
  call.** 90 cells exist; 54 name an implementation and could one day carry
  `dev`. The other 36 are `wall` (the platform forbids it) or `—`, and never
  can. The page states the arithmetic rather than presenting 54 as a given.
- **P3 — a `dev` pill is allowed in a legend, and only there.** §8.1 forbids a
  *claim* of device verification; a definition sitting beside the count
  "0 cells" is the opposite of one. `check-matrix.mjs` now enforces exactly
  that: no `dev` in a `<td>`, none outside a `<dl class="legend">`, and the
  legend entry must still read 0.
- **P3 — the 29 `—` cells are deliberately not in the tab order.** A dash is
  self-evident, and keeping them focusable buried the 60 cells that say
  something behind 89 tab stops. Hover still shows the definition.
- **P3 — the gate was fault-injected, not assumed.** Three drifts were
  introduced and each was caught: a tag upgraded in the JSON only, a rendered
  cell claiming more than the data, and a `dev` pill smuggled into a cell.
- **P3 — `site.yml` runs both gates plus a third-party-asset grep.** It ran on
  GitHub for the P3 push (`0f2961a`) and passed in 21s — verified on the
  runner, not just locally. The Pages deploy job itself is still P6.
- **P4 — a real bug shipped through three phases: every page scrolled
  sideways.** The evidence-tag tooltip is absolutely positioned and was hidden
  with `opacity: 0`, which still contributes to scrollable overflow — so all 90
  matrix cells and every inline tag widened their page. Fixed with
  `display: none`. It survived P1–P3 because the overflow assertion ran at one
  viewport width; it now runs at 390, 834 and 1440, and is a standing gate.
- **P4 — plan 10 §2 says adoption "rungs 2 and 4 already done"; rung 2 is only
  partly done.** `docs/protocol.md` is frozen at v1 and `PROTOCOL_CHANGES.md`
  exists, but there is no `/spec`, no semver beyond "v1", and only five
  MUST/SHOULD in the whole document — not the RFC-style versioned spec rung 2
  describes. The site says "partly". **Worth Auston's eye: either the site is
  right and the plan is optimistic, or rung 2's bar is lower than it reads.**
- **P4 — the judge quote is corrected from the auto-transcript.** The recording
  renders it "abstracting the lesson to the network"; the site quotes "the OS",
  as plan 10 §2 does, and says so directly under the quote. The Wi-Fi Direct
  quote is punctuated but otherwise unchanged, and says so.
- **P4 — the 2013 customer-validation names are not on the site at all.** The
  transcript brackets them (`[Rep A]`, `[Rep B]`, `[Tester A]`); rather than
  reproduce bracketed placeholders, the willingness-to-pay evidence is simply
  omitted. Redactions hold by not quoting them.
- **P4 — one headline was walked back during self-review.** "Five things this
  will never do" contradicted its own fourth item, which says *today*.
- **P5 — the three headline figures are now gated, everywhere they appear.**
  `data-fig="swift|go|kotlin"` markers are checked against the README's own
  re-verification line by `check-matrix.mjs`; there are 15 of them across the
  seal, the home band, the quickstart headings and the status ledger. Proven
  by fault injection.
- **P5 — `check-commands.mjs` is now a repo tool and a CI step**, as P2 said it
  should become here. 28 commands in 9 blocks, all verbatim. Only blocks marked
  `data-source="readme"` are checked, so `/protocol` can show wire-format
  specimens without tripping it.
- **P5 — the seal labels its units rather than following §4.3.7 literally.**
  The spec says "Swift · Go · Kotlin with their vector counts", but Swift's
  headline number is 126 *tests*, not vectors — the shared vector set is 52.
  The seal therefore reads "Swift 126 tests · Go 52 vectors · Kotlin 70
  vectors", which is what the README says.
- **P5 — `docs/protocol.md` still says "Two implementations pass these
  vectors byte-for-byte."** Kotlin is the third and is conformance-tested, per
  the README. The site says three and links to that doc, so a reader who
  clicks through hits the contradiction. **Not fixed here — it is outside
  `site/`, and CONTRIBUTING's rule is that the protocol doc moves with the
  wire. Auston's call.**
- **P6 — shipped 2026-08-12 to https://snoobiejunes.github.io/mosis/.**
  Reviewed, then merged to `main` (`31a65d6`); Pages enabled with
  `build_type: workflow`; `pages.yml` ran the three gates and deployed in 29s.
  The GitHub repo was renamed `conduit` → `mosis` to get that path, because a
  project Pages site is served at `/<repo-name>/`. Nothing about the local
  checkout or the code's `conduit`/`cndt` identifiers moved — the staged code
  rename is still plan 01.
- **P6 — Lighthouse on the live deployment beats the local figure**, as
  predicted: **97, 98, 97, 98, 98, 97** performance and 100 accessibility, up
  from 95–96 locally, because Pages serves over HTTP/2 and multiplexes the
  three stylesheets the local harness serialised.
- **P6 — the deploy emits a Node-20 deprecation annotation**, not a failure:
  `actions/checkout@v4`, `configure-pages@v5`, `setup-node@v4`,
  `upload-pages-artifact@v3` and `deploy-pages@v4` are forced onto Node 24 by
  the runner (corrected 2026-08-17: the workflow uses
  `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3`, not `upload-artifact@v4`). Worth bumping
  when GitHub ships v5s.
- **P6 — the Lighthouse numbers are measured, and where matters.** Against
  `python -m http.server` performance scored 86–90, failing on `cache-insight`
  and `document-latency-insight` — properties of that server (HTTP/1.0, no
  keep-alive, no gzip, no cache header), not of the site. Re-measured against a
  static server that behaves like Pages (gzip, `max-age=600`, keep-alive):
  **95, 95, 95, 96, 96, 96**, accessibility 100 across the board, best
  practices 100, SEO 100. The real figure on Pages should be at or above that,
  since HTTP/2 multiplexes the three stylesheets this harness serialised.
- **P6 — ~~`sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` hard-code
  `snoobiejunes.github.io/conduit`~~ — FIXED the same day** in `ca83227`; both
  now point at `/mosis/`. They are still the only absolute URLs on the site. The
  sitemap lists the six routes and omits `kitchen-sink.html`, which is what P1's
  "excluded from the sitemap" was waiting for.
- **P6 — `site.yml` now ignores pushes to `main`**, because `pages.yml` runs
  the same three gates there before deploying. Pull requests still run
  `site.yml`.

## Revision after Auston's review (2026-08-11)

Direction: stop leading with "none of this is device-tested" — it undersells
work that is genuinely solid — keep the honesty in the footer, and turn the
page into a call for testers. Plus: show more than pairing, drop the judge
quote for the benefits of peer-to-peer, add a Browser column.

- [x] The zero counter is gone from the body of all six pages. The honest line
      now lives in the footer of every page, and in the `/status` band that
      asks for testers.
- [x] `/` gained a **capability showcase** — screens both directions,
      clipboard, files, input, browser cast — each card carrying the macOS tag
      pulled from `matrix.json`, so the showcase cannot out-claim the ledger.
- [x] `/` and `/status` gained a **coverage panel**: which platforms have been
      run on hardware, which have nobody, and an "I have one →" link that opens
      a pre-titled device report.
- [x] `/story`: judge quote and transcript link removed; **"Why go direct at
      all?"** added with Auston's seven reasons plus privacy and
      works-when-the-internet-doesn't.
- [x] **Browser column** added to the README matrix and therefore to the site:
      90 cells → 105, 54 claimed → 56, footnote ¹⁴ says plainly that Browser is
      not a platform port.
- [x] README's status section rewritten to lead with what is proven and to name
      what has been run by hand.
- [x] All six pages were **re-emitted from one shared shell**, so the footer and
      the seal do not currently drift. Stated precisely (2026-08-17): there is no
      shell/template *generator* in the repo — plan 10 forbids a build step — so
      this is a one-time alignment, not a standing guarantee. Only the seal's
      numbers are CI-checked; a hand-edit to one page's footer would pass every
      gate. (One already happened: the hero label was removed from `index.html`
      alone in `5ac615f`.)

### Open questions for Auston — these are the ones I did not answer for you

1. **Which cells should turn `dev`?** You ran macOS ↔ iPhone and the browser
   viewer. The matrix still shows `bld` for every iOS cell, because I drew the
   line at *checklist-verified*, not *worked when I tried it* — and `/status`
   says so out loud. That line is my invention. If hands-on counts, tell me
   which capabilities you exercised and I will turn those cells.
2. **AWDL.** You said it was tested. That would move path-ladder rung 2 off
   "spike pending", and possibly more. I did not act on it, because I cannot
   tell from here what was exercised or on what. What did you run?
### Answered, and acted on (2026-08-11)

1. **Pairing is not restricted to your own devices.** The `/story` section
   claiming "presenting to a device you don't own" was a gap was simply wrong,
   and it came from plan 06's gap analysis. Anyone in the room can pair —
   the trust is the six digits and the word pair on both screens. That section
   now says the 2013 demo's hardest promise works, and the pairing chip on `/`
   says so too. **Plan 06 §"The real gaps" items 1 and 2 should be corrected or
   struck; the site no longer agrees with them.**
2. **15 cells now carry `dev`**, from the iPhone ↔ Mac session: pairing, file
   transfer, clipboard, iPhone-drives-Mac, screen sharing both ways, and the
   browser watch page. Marked as macOS ×7, iOS ×6, Browser ×2 — the exact list
   is in the commit message and in README footnote ¹⁵. Two long-standing fakes
   are retired with it: footnote ⁵ (the `CGEvent` injector had never moved a
   real cursor) and footnote ⁷ (real ScreenCaptureKit capture was device-gated).
3. **AWDL moved past design.** Path-ladder rung 2 reads *proven* for the
   Apple↔Apple half; the Wi-Fi Aware half (iPhone↔iPad) is still written-only.
   README's plan-08 bullet says the same. **ADR 0017 and plan 08 still describe
   the whole ladder as design — they are outside `site/` and are yours to
   update.**
4. **iPad is listed as untried**, in its own coverage tile with an "I have one"
   link.

### Still open

- **`Watch and drive, one surface` was not marked `dev`.** You listed screen
  sharing and the trackpad separately; ADR 0015's absolute-pointing surface is
  a distinct capability and I did not assume it. If you drove the Mac *while*
  watching it, say so and it turns.
- **Multi-viewer likewise stayed at `E2E`** — more than one viewer at once was
  not in your list.
- **`docs/protocol.md` still says "Two implementations pass these vectors
  byte-for-byte."** Kotlin is the third. Unchanged from before; still yours.
